**Ground Rules**
Before you report a 'Bug', you need to make sure you have read the accompanying Descriptions on the templates and the READ.ME for the GIT Repo completely and followed all the settings required there.
This is important as if these instructions are not followed, you will likely have a bad day and be forced to contact me for help.  Not that I don't want to help, but personal interaction takes me a while to respond and is generally non-productive.

Another good thing to do before you ask for help is try testing what you have in the Developer Tools Template Tab in Home Assistant. There you can adjust this and that until you figure out the answer to your question yourself.  [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show your template developer tools.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/developer_template.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/developer_template/)

Issues are not a place to ask questions, see the Discord links below for that.  This is for broken things. If you are not sure, PLEASE go to Discord and ask the question first.

If you have a general question, I prefer them to be asked on Discord.  Ping me in the channel, I don't often respond to DM's...   @sirgoodenough  

I also monitor the Blueprint Exchange post related to each Blueprint and will respond there.

There are 3 places on Discord that I monitor, in preference order:

My personal Discord Blueprints Channel:  https://discord.gg/SKsAgCHvUm
DrZzs Home Assistant channel:                 https://discord.gg/pGzB8P5W4n
Home Assistant Template Channel: https://discord.gg/home-assistant

Do if you think you found a bug where the text points you wrong, or something is just broken, continue here.  If you have a Feature Request, see the other Issue Template...
